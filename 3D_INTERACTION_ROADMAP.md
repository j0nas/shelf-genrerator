# 3D Direct Manipulation Roadmap for Shelf Generator

## Vision
Transform the shelf generator from traditional left-panel controls to direct 3D manipulation with **smart sectioning** - where users can split existing sections at their center points by hovering and clicking directly on the 3D model.

## Current State ✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE, READY FOR ADVANCED FEATURES
- **Direct 3D Manipulation**: Hover empty space → green ghost → click to add divider
- **Basic Divider Removal**: Hover existing divider → red highlight → click to remove  
- **Smart Sectioning**: Ghost appears at section centers, respects minimum sizes
- **Seamless Integration**: 3D interactions sync with left panel controls
- **Unit Support**: Works flawlessly with metric/imperial conversion
- **Coordinate System**: Virtual plane raycasting provides pixel-perfect accuracy

**Next Level Goal**: Transform simple click-to-remove into comprehensive drag-to-position with measurements and multi-state interaction!

## Target State - Professional 3D Direct Manipulation
- **Smart Adding**: Hover empty sections → ghost divider at center → click to add
- **Smart Positioning**: Hover existing dividers → show measurements → click to select → drag to reposition
- **Smart Removal**: Selected divider shows floating "×" button → click to delete
- **Live Feedback**: Real-time measurements, drag constraints, and positioning guides
- **State Management**: Clear visual states (hover/selected/dragging) with intuitive transitions
- **Professional Feel**: CAD-level precision with consumer-friendly discoverability
- Left panel becomes pure configuration (materials, dimensions, etc.)
- All divider manipulation happens directly in 3D space

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation - 3D Mouse Interaction ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Establish basic 3D mouse position detection and coordinate system

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add raycasting setup to ShelfGenerator class
- [x] Create method to convert 3D world coordinates to shelf interior space
- [x] Add mouse move event listener to 3D canvas
- [x] Add debug mode to visualize raycast intersections
- [x] Add UI toggle for debug mode
- [x] Test coordinate conversion accuracy across different camera angles

**Files modified:**
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Added raycasting, coordinate conversion, debug visualization
- `js/main.js` - Added mouse events and debug toggle
- `index.html` - Added debug button to viewer controls

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Console logs accurate Y-position in shelf interior space when hovering
- ✅ Debug mode shows red sphere at intersection points
- ✅ Unit conversion works (metric/imperial)
- ✅ Works consistently across all camera views (front, side, top, iso)

---

### Phase 2: Smart Section Detection & Ghost Dividers ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Detect which section mouse is hovering and show ghost divider at section center

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement section detection logic (which space between existing dividers)
- [x] Calculate center point of hovered section
- [x] Create ghost divider material (transparent, distinct color)
- [x] Show ghost divider at section center when hovering
- [x] Handle edge case: empty shelf (show ghost at overall center)
- [x] Hide ghost when hovering existing dividers or outside shelf

**Smart Sectioning Logic:**
- ✅ Empty shelf → ghost at vertical center
- ✅ With dividers → detect which section mouse is in, show ghost at that section's center
- ✅ Minimum section height enforcement (prevent tiny unusable spaces)

**Files modified:**
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Section detection, ghost divider rendering, virtual plane raycasting
- `js/main.js` - Section calculation helpers

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Ghost divider appears at center of hovered section
- ✅ Works with 0, 1, 2+ existing dividers
- ✅ Ghost disappears when hovering outside shelf
- ✅ Prevents creation of sections smaller than minimum usable height

**Key Technical Breakthrough:**
- Resolved coordinate system issues by implementing virtual plane raycasting
- Ghost divider now appears accurately when hovering anywhere in empty shelf interior
- Proper coordinate conversion between 3D world space and shelf interior units

**Implementation Details:**
- Virtual plane positioned at front face of shelf interior (not visible to user)
- Raycasting against plane provides accurate 3D intersection points
- Coordinate conversion: World Y → Shelf Interior Y → Current Units (metric/imperial)
- Debug logging cleaned up (only shows when debug mode is enabled)
- Smart sectioning works with empty shelves and shelves with existing dividers

---

### Phase 3: Hover State for Existing Dividers ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Visual feedback when hovering existing dividers

**Tasks:**
- [x] Detect when hovering existing horizontal dividers
- [x] Add highlight material/effect for hovered dividers
- [x] Show visual indication that divider can be removed
- [x] Handle hover conflicts (ghost vs existing divider)
- [x] Click-to-remove functionality (bonus feature!)

**Files modified:**
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Divider metadata, hover detection, highlighting, click removal

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Existing dividers highlight when hovered (red material)
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between "add" (green ghost) and "remove" (red highlight) modes
- ✅ No z-fighting or visual glitches
- ✅ Hover states work with colored compartments
- ✅ Priority system: existing divider hover overrides ghost divider

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `userData` metadata to horizontal divider meshes for identification
- Red highlight material (`0xff4444`) clearly indicates removal mode
- Material swapping system preserves and restores original appearance
- Click detection: red divider = remove, green ghost = add
- Priority-based hover: existing divider detection takes precedence over ghost

**User Experience:**
- **Hover empty space** → Green ghost divider (add preview)
- **Hover existing divider** → Red highlight (remove preview)  
- **Click green ghost** → Add divider at position
- **Click red divider** → Remove divider immediately
- **Clear visual language**: Green = Add, Red = Remove

### Phase 4: Advanced Divider Manipulation ✅ COMPLETED (With Bug Fixes)
**Goal:** Multi-state interaction system with drag-to-move and enhanced visual feedback

**MAJOR BUG DISCOVERED & FIXED:**
- **Issue**: Clicking anywhere while divider selected caused unwanted divider movement
- **Root Cause**: Mousedown on selected divider immediately started drag, mouseup ended drag and moved divider
- **Solution**: Added movement threshold - drag only starts after 5+ pixel mouse movement
- **Debugging Lesson**: Should have logged ALL mouse events (down/up/move/click) from start

**Three-State Interaction Design: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

**State 1: Hover (Information Mode)** ✅
- Show distance measurements above/below divider
- Subtle visual indicator of interactivity
- Display compartment heights in current units

**State 2: Selected (Action Mode)** ✅  
- Click divider to select → strong highlight + floating "×" button
- Enable drag-to-move functionality (with proper movement threshold)
- Show drag handles or positioning guides
- Clear visual feedback that divider is in "action mode"

**State 3: Dragging (Live Positioning)** ✅
- Real-time position updates during drag
- Live measurement feedback
- Smart constraints (min/max positions, collision detection)
- Snap to reasonable increments
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid positions

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement three-state interaction system
- [x] Add measurement overlay system (distances above/below)
- [x] Create floating "×" button for selected dividers
- [x] Implement drag-to-move with live constraints
- [x] Add smart snapping and positioning feedback
- [x] Handle state transitions (hover → select → drag → deselect)
- [x] Preserve existing click-to-add ghost divider functionality
- [x] **Fix critical drag detection bug** (25+ iteration debugging session!)

**CURRENT STATUS**: Core functionality works, delete button disabled due to refactoring

**Files to modify:**
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Multi-state system, drag handlers, measurements
- Consider new file: `js/3d-measurements.js` - Measurement overlay system
- Consider new file: `js/divider-interaction-states.js` - State management

**Success criteria:**
- Hover divider → show measurements (non-intrusive)
- Click divider → enter selected state with "×" button
- Drag selected divider → smooth repositioning with live feedback
- Click "×" → delete divider  
- Click elsewhere → deselect and return to normal mode
- All interactions feel smooth and discoverable
- Measurements are accurate and clearly displayed
- Drag constraints prevent invalid positions
- Compatible with existing ghost divider system

**Interaction Flow Examples:**
```
Add new divider:
Empty space → Hover → Ghost appears → Click → Divider added

Reposition existing divider:  
Existing divider → Hover → Measurements appear → Click → Selected state + "×" button
→ Drag → Live positioning → Release → Updated position

Delete existing divider:
Existing divider → Hover → Measurements appear → Click → Selected state + "×" button  
→ Click "×" → Confirmation → Deleted

Deselect:
Selected divider → Click elsewhere → Return to normal state
```

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Extend existing `detectHoveredExistingDivider()` to include measurement calculation
- Add state management: `NORMAL`, `HOVERING`, `SELECTED`, `DRAGGING`  
- Create floating UI elements (measurements, "×" button) positioned in 3D space
- Implement drag constraints: min/max positions based on adjacent dividers
- Live position updates during drag with visual feedback
- Preserve all existing ghost divider functionality for adding new dividers

---

### Phase 5: Click Interactions ✅ COMPLETED EARLY (Integrated with Phase 3)
**Goal:** Make buttons functional - add/remove dividers via 3D clicks

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add click event detection (direct on geometry, no buttons needed)
- [x] Implement addDividerAt3DPosition(yPosition) method
- [x] Implement removeDividerAt3DPosition(dividerId) method
- [x] Sync 3D changes with left panel configuration
- [x] Handle edge cases (clicking between buttons and geometry)

**Files modified:**
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Click detection and divider management (integrated with hover)
- `js/main.js` - Integration with existing divider logic

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Clicking green ghost adds divider at correct position
- ✅ Clicking red highlighted divider removes correct divider
- ✅ Left panel updates immediately to reflect changes
- ✅ No duplicate or phantom dividers

**Implementation Note:**
Phase 5 was completed early by integrating click functionality directly into Phase 3's hover system. This approach proved more intuitive than separate 3D buttons - users can directly click the visual preview (ghost or highlight) to perform the action.

### Phase 5: State Management Migration ⏳ NEXT PHASE
**Goal:** Migrate to XState for robust state management and prevent future bugs

**Why This Phase:**
- Current vanilla JS state management led to 25+ iteration debugging session
- Phase 6+ requires even more complex state transitions
- XState provides compile-time guarantees and visual debugging
- TypeScript integration will catch state-related bugs immediately

**Migration Strategy:**
1. **Week 1: Setup & Learning**
   - Install XState + TypeScript
   - Convert existing files to `.ts` (incremental typing)
   - Create basic state machine alongside existing code
   
2. **Week 2: Core State Migration**
   - Replace `interactionState` with XState machine
   - Migrate: normal → hovering → selected → dragging states
   - Keep all existing Three.js logic unchanged
   
3. **Week 3: Advanced States**
   - Add delete confirmation states
   - Implement proper drag preparation → dragging flow
   - Add visual debugging for state transitions
   
4. **Week 4: Cleanup & Testing**
   - Remove old state management code
   - Test all interaction flows
   - Document state machine for future development

**Expected Benefits:**
- Impossible to get into invalid states
- Visual debugging of state transitions
- Type safety for all state-related code
- Easier implementation of Phases 6-7
- Better developer experience

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install XState and TypeScript
- [ ] Convert js files to ts (incremental)
- [ ] Create divider interaction state machine
- [ ] Migrate click handlers to use state machine
- [ ] Migrate drag detection to use state machine
- [ ] Add visual state debugging
- [ ] Remove old state management code
- [ ] Re-enable delete button with proper state management
- [ ] Test all interaction flows
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 6: Enhanced UX Polish ⏳ AFTER PHASE 5
**Goal:** Polish the multi-state interaction system and add smart behaviors

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Polish state transition animations and feedback
- [ ] Add minimum spacing constraints (prevent dividers too close together)  
- [ ] Smart positioning (snap to useful increments, avoid tiny spaces)
- [ ] Enhance measurement display system (typography, positioning, units)
- [ ] Add undo/redo for 3D operations
- [ ] Improve mobile/touch support for 3D interactions
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (ESC to deselect, DEL to delete selected)
- [ ] Polish floating "×" button (hover states, positioning, visibility)

**Files to modify:**
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Animation system, smart constraints
- `js/main.js` - Undo/redo and keyboard handling  
- `styles.css` - Measurement overlay styling

**Success criteria:**
- State transitions feel smooth and natural
- Dividers can't be placed too close to existing ones
- Position snapping feels natural and helpful
- Measurements are clearly readable and well-positioned
- Touch devices have equivalent functionality
- All interactions feel polished and professional
- Keyboard shortcuts enhance power-user workflow

---

### Phase 7: Contextual Configuration ✓ Depends on Phase 6
**Goal:** Replace left panel divider list with contextual popups

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add click-to-configure mode for existing dividers
- [ ] Create floating configuration panel for selected divider
- [ ] Show vertical divider controls contextually
- [ ] Position adjustment via direct drag or input field
- [ ] Update left panel to remove divider list section

**Files to modify:**
- `js/main.js` - Remove divider list rendering
- `js/shelf-generator.js` - Contextual UI panels
- `styles.css` - Floating panel styles

**Success criteria:**
- Clicking existing divider opens configuration popup
- Configuration changes update 3D model immediately
- Left panel is cleaner with just global settings
- No confusion about where to configure things

---

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Raycasting on every mouse move - need efficient intersection detection
- Ghost divider updates - minimize geometry creation/destruction
- Button positioning - cache calculations where possible

### Browser Compatibility  
- Three.js raycasting works on all modern browsers
- Touch events need special handling for mobile
- Consider fallback to left panel on very old browsers

### Edge Cases
- Very thin shelves (depth < 6 inches)
- Extreme camera angles (looking from below)
- Rapid mouse movements
- Multiple dividers in close proximity

### User Testing Points
- After Phase 2: Is ghost divider intuitive?
- After Phase 5: Can users successfully add/remove dividers?
- After Phase 7: Is the new workflow clearly better than the old one?

---

## Success Metrics

**Usability:**
- Can new users add their first divider without instructions?
- Time to create a 3-divider shelf configuration
- Error rate (accidentally adding/removing dividers)

**Technical:**
- Smooth 60fps interaction even with complex shelves
- Accurate positioning across all camera views
- No visual glitches or z-fighting

**Completeness:**
- All existing functionality preserved
- No regression in cut list generation
- Mobile users have equivalent workflow

---

## Rollback Plan
Each phase builds incrementally. If any phase proves too complex or problematic:
1. Keep working phases enabled
2. Disable problematic phase
3. Fall back to left panel for missing functionality
4. Document lessons learned for future attempt

The beauty of this approach is that even Phase 2 alone (ghost divider preview) would be a significant UX improvement over the current system.
